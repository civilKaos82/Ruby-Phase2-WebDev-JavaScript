Welcome to Phase-2!

Starting next week, you will apply your knowledge to the web, and we will introduce you to new concepts and technologies.

These will include:
HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language (structure)
CSS - Cascading Style Sheets (presentation)
HTTP - Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (facilitates communication between your web browser and the web server)
Sinatra - (helpful library for building web apps in Ruby)
JavaScript (the language)
jQuery (JavaScript library for manipulating web pages)
AJAX - (Make HTTP requests in a browser without loading a new page)
Phase 2 moves quickly because we've got so much ground to cover. By the end of Phase 2, you'll be building your own web apps, which is every bit as amazing as it sounds.

Given the pace of next phase, prep this weekend is crucial (so is taking care of yourself). In the next three weeks, you will become a web developer.

THIS WEEKEND:

Complete the Prep work in the Phase 2 Guide

<github cohort org>/phase-2-guide/blob/chicago/week-4/pre-work.md

We're going to cover introductions to HTTP and Sinatra, as well as touching on a harder ActiveRecord challenge. Sinatra is the web framework we'll be using throughout the phase. Read the tutorial and follow the examples -- you should create a small Sinatra app if you're actually following along. Don't just read. Get your hands dirty.

See you Monday!
