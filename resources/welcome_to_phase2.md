## Dev Bootcamp Phase 2

Hi and welcome to Phase 2. I heard you were really really REALLY ready for THE super great extra ultra awesome growth experience you signed up for...

First things first, if you haven't taken a break yet, you should. You can safely skip reading this email now and just get to it Sunday if you're already exhausted. Don't worry, you'll learn much faster when you're happy and playful anyway. For future reference, DBC recommends a minimum of 6 and a maximum of 8 **non coding/sleeping** hours in a standard weekend.


### Overview

##### The last three weeks have made you a programmer. The next three weeks will make you a Jr Web Developer.

To do so, you'll need to be conversational in five languages:

* HTML (for architecture and design)
* CSS (for style and presentation)
* JavaScript (for dynamic and asynchronous content)
* Ruby (for server-side logic written in the Sinatra framework)
* SQL (for database persistence with an ActiveRecord interface)

Within those languages, we will be:

* Testing our code using RSpec, Jasmine and Selenium
* Deploying apps using Heroku
* Interfacing and gathering data from third-party application APIs
* Building our own API to give the world our data

Before Monday, you should be able to do the following:

* Have a basic grasp of the request-response cycle terminology.
* Write a 'Hello World'  app using Sinatra.
* Access and use a Rakefile.
* Manipulate and use a Gemfile.
* Write an ActiveRecord migration.
* Write an ActiveRecord-backed model.
* Write basic associations (has_many and belongs_to) in ActiveRecord.
* Understand how a many-to-many association in ActiveRecord works.
* Use Git to add, commit, push, pull, and branch.
* Make and accept pull requests on Github.
* HTML & CSS contribute to the 'View' layer of your application. Have basic conversational knowledge of syntax for both.

Over the course of the phase you are going to be exposed to many underlying aspects of topics listed above. Many of which won't be explicitly covered in the phase guide. (mostly because it's a guide not a bible) It is up to you to bring breakout topics to the board everyday.

### Nightly Prep:

Each day of your DBC experience moving forward will serve to strengthen your fortitude as a developer. You and you alone are the master of that destiny. To that end, phase two is intentionally setup to require that you take a stronger role in shaping your own journey.

Phase 2 students are expected to front load basic concepts each night before the next days challenge. Look through your challenges, determine key skills needed and scrape through provided resources to gain knowledge. The goal of such study is to provide you with at least a minimum exposure level knowledge of topics coming up.

Your primary resource for this should be [DBC Talks](https://talks.devbootcamp.com). Some concepts will have talks linked in the guide, others you will have to search out on your own.

I recommend ~2X speed using the video speed controller extension for chrome. Your brain can keep up, I promise.

### Meta Skills

A short article on embracing confusion:

### Reading

Make a habit to spend 10-20 minutes each day this week to read through these links about Active Record until they start to seem boring and familiar. Then find something else to read until it seems boring and familiar. Wash rinse repeat.

  - http://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html

  - http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Associations/ClassMethods.html

### Sinatra:

The [Snitching on Sinatra](../../../../snitching-on-sinatra-challenge) tutorial will help you get an understanding of basic HTTP and Sinatra. The Sinatra [readme](http://www.sinatrarb.com/intro.html) is also an excellent source of information if you want more.

### Phase Guide:

This phase guide is a bit more complex than your Phase 1 guide in both structure and designed interface. It's got more content, less explicit pointers and more challenges. The organizational structure is different. Things may seem a little weird or perhaps a bit daunting at first. _The moral of the story is this,_ Roll with the punches, dig a little deeper into the resources you have, find the things you are looking for and move along accordingly.

### HTTP:

Check out the following article and talk. Keep in mind that the Internet is just a bunch of computers texting each other according to some very specific and well documented rules.

### < peptalk >

You're going to spend the next three weeks learning more than you ever thought possible. Embrace your confusion. You are training to be web developers. The whole job is a recursive call to 'WHAT! That didn't work, WHY NOT>??<, OK try this'. You are training to be professionally confused. You're going to be great at it. Lots of stuff is happening at once, which for professional developers absolutely has to be **no big deal**.

Being good at being confused means you:

  * Process problems into undersized understandable chunks
  * Calmly iterate over each, building little blocks of understanding
  * Develop a solid ability to find the answers you are looking for
  * Maintain a positive emotional relationship with not understanding an issue
  * Understand that generally* everything works, it's your job to play around until it clicks in
  * Communicate your problem clearly, understand and explore the edges
  * PSEUDO....a lot of pseudo

Phase 2 is quite possibly the hardest thing you will ever do from an educational perspective. Cohesion with your cohort mates is the number two thing you can do to improve the quality of your Phase 2 experience. (The number one thing is approaching the challenges with a playful, exploratory mindset, seriously...) A cohort that conquers the unknown though sharing and collaboration will be exponentially better off in every way. It is not a given, each and every one of you has a role in realizing goal. Staff is here to support you as you grow in your technical and emotional intelligence. Which is not to say you are own your own. Rather, it is by design that your learning efforts should become more self and team focused as you progress through this phase. DBC is about getting you ready to be a real world developer. In that world the only hand holding will come from yourself and your team.

Speaking of teams. Team dynamics are sometimes great. Sometimes tough. Life is super easy when your on that perfect team... Striving toward great team dynamics can be especially hard though in a not perfect team environment. That is also the time when your skills are extra super rewarding. As DBC Boots you shall hone your ability to have a great working relationship within any team dynamic.

Team dynamic skills include:

  * Embracing your differences
  * Actively engaging with every team member
  * Ensuring everyone is "skilled up"
  * Contributing 100% to making a great product and making a great team

Finally lets talk about cake. Phase 2 is for sure no cake walk. Actually there is no cake... You will need to push your limits technically and emotionally everyday to find success. The individual concepts are not so bad, but there is a square metric ton of them. Dedication to growing outside your normal bounds through a constant state of confusion will be the norm. A task which is not only doable, but is truly the 'secret sauce' you get here at Dev Bootcamp. The thing that will make you kickass developers for literally(figuratively) the rest of your lives. So YaY!

#### Parting thought:
If you haven't figured it out yet, your [Phase 2 Guide](../README.md) is live. Github permissions can be a pain and sometimes things break. If you encounter a link that doesn't work during the phase just shoot an instructor an email and We'll get it fixed.

Keep your head calm, your heart strong and your commits super legit... Everything else will work out.

OK that's it that's all, Happy Hacking Boots.
