# Assessment

For those of you who have asked to be assessed, you will need to:

1. Review the [learning objectives](week-3/learning-objectives.md)
2. Prepare code you are familiar with that exhibits Active Record, Sinatra,
   Testing, Javascript, and manipulating the DOM.


## Location
Assessments will be done at the standing table. I'd recommend setting up your
code tonight to ensure the database and everything works.

## Schedule

Be at the computer, ready to be assessed 2 minutes before your assessment is
supposed to begin.
