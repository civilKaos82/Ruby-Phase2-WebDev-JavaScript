# SOLO TFD DAY
Taken from the popular (and sometimes necessary) AFD (alcohol free day) idea, a
TFD (testing free day) is useful when you just need to focus your learning on
specific topics and not on building a full tested web app.

* Welcome to your **TFD**

1. [Learning Objectives](#learning-objectives)
1. [Instructions](#instructions)


## Learning Objectives
Solidify your learning on one or more of your week 1 and week 2 learning
objectives.  **Ignore all testing**

* Take the time to work solo and accurately assess your learning and knowledge.

## Instructions

* Choose a challenge below based on it's learning objectives.
* Journal your learning - discuss how your code / coding process illustrates
  each objective.
