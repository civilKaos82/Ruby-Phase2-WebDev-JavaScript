## Summary

JQuery is a powerful JavaScript library that allows you to manipulate DOM
elements.  One fun way to practice jQuery is to use the Chrome Console to run
jQuery command on an existing web site and modify its appearance and behavior.


## Releases

Spend 15 minutes on each of the following hacks to the Socrates website, work
with a new pair on each hack.  Use the Chrome Console to run your hacks.


### Release 1

* Use basic selectors (id, class, element) to choose an element on the page.
* Use the .css() method to alter at least two CSS properties of this element.

### Release 2

* Use basic selectors and the find() method to select an image on the page and
  change it with another image of your choice.
* Add a background image to a <div> element on the page.

### Release 3

* Use traverse methods (like filtering or tree traversal) to select all
  instances of a repeated element on the page ( like the h3 surrounding the
  words 'Code Review' )
* Use the animate() method to modify the selected element.
* Explore the animate() method and call it in several ways.

### Release 4

* Select elements from the navbar and use the .on() method to bind an event
  handler on these elements (use an event other than click).
* Append link elements to the navbar and use the .on() method to add click
  events to these links which modify various parts of the page (ex: change the
  background to pink and all the images to smile when you click on 'Be Happy')

### Release 5
* Use Child Filter or Content Filter Selectors to remove elements from the page
  when the mouse hovers over them.

### Release 6
