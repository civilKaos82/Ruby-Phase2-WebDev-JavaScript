# Friday

## Mock Assessment
- [CRUD Mock Assessment](../../../../phase-2-mock-assessment-echo)

## Core Challenges
With your pair (someone you have NOT paired with this week - or that you haven't paired much with), work on the following challenges.

- [Simon Says](../../../../simon-says-challenge)
- [Lucky AJAX](../../../../lucky-ajax-challenge) - If you worked on this yesterday during instructor pairing, try to start fresh WITHOUT looking at your previous solution. This will help you learn more than copy/pasting and you might come up with a better solution.
- [CRUD AJAX](../../../../ajax-review-challenge)
