# Weekend

Review [learning competencies self-assessment](../self-assessments#week-2)

## Core Challenges
### OOJS (Object Oriented JavaScript)

We haven't talked about OOJS yet, but it's an important concept to start wrapping your head around.

- Read [Intro to OOJS](https://gist.github.com/alycit/e6f5f20ced9b42a64f5a)
- [OOJS with Gardens](../../../../oojs-garden-challenge)

### AJAX

Continue practicing and slowly working to demystify asynchronous requests and DOM manipulation. It's easy to want to copy and paste your setup from another challenge, but try first to pull from your memory. Try things in the console and don't resist using `console.log()` and `debugger` to help understand the state of your code.

- [AJAX your CRUD apps](../../../../ajax-review-challenge)

### CRUD

Practicing CRUD is highly suggested this weekend. How you do that is completely up to you. I've included the below challenges for you if you don't have another personal CRUD app you want to build.

- [Hacker News Clone Part One](../../../../hacker-news-clone-part-1-challenge)
- [Hacker News Clone Part Two](../../../../hacker-news-clone-part-2-challenge)

### ActiveRecord Associations

If you need more practice with AR Associations, complete the shirts challenge. It is definitely challenging, but it will help prepare you immensely for the assessment, phase three, and the rest of your career.

### Stretch

If you're feeling great about all the concepts we've covered so far (I know there's been a lot), feel free to dive deeper into and build the following!
