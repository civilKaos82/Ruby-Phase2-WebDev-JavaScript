# Weekend

Review [learning competencies self-assessment](./self-assessments.md)

## Survey Gorilla
Complete this challenge with your group. I'd spend one day of the weekend wrapping up this challenge. It's a great chance to practice both CRUD/REST & AJAX.

Make sure to:
- follow and practice agile processes
- work on things *you aren't the best at*

## Review or Advance
**Review**: Use the remainder of the weekend to review the mock and solo challenges from the last week.  
-or-  
**Advance**: If you're confident in the material from last week, here some some challenges that will push you a bit futher in your understanding of AJAX & Javascript:
* [Exploring Asynchrony Challenge](../../../../exploring-asynchrony-challenge)
* [Meditation Trainer](../../../../meditation-trainer-challenge)
