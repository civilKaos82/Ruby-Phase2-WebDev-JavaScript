## Mock Assessment

## Intro to JavaScript

Read [JavaScript Intro](../readings/javascript-intro.md).

Work through the drills and read the material in [From Ruby to JavaScript](../../../../javascript-from-ruby-challenge). Complete all the drills. Pay extra close attention to the drills on Functions, Collections, and Objects and Classes.
