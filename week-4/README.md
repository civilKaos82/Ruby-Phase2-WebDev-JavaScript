Welcome to Phase 2!

Starting next week, you'll apply what you've learned so far to the web, and we will introduce you to new concepts and technologies.

These will include:
HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language (structure)
CSS - Cascading Style Sheets (presentation)
HTTP - Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (facilitates communication between your web browser and the web server)
Sinatra - (helpful library for building web apps in Ruby)
JavaScript (the language)
jQuery (JavaScript library for manipulating web pages)
AJAX - (Make HTTP requests in a browser without loading a new page)

That's a lot. It's a whole lot. Get ready to drink from an information fire hose. 

Phase 2 moves quickly because we've got so much ground to cover. And by the end of the phase, you'll be building your own web apps, which is every bit as amazing as it sounds.

Given the pace of next phase, prep this weekend is crucial. I recommend leaving comments at places in your code where you get a little stuck or can't grok why something you wrote ended up working. 

Because you'll want those notes the next time you build a web app, and this is a phase where you'll want to build practice apps over and over again, outside of core hours, to develop the muscle memory you need to wrangle all these moving parts into a well-designed whole.

A wise dog once said: "sucking at something is the first step to becoming sorta good at something." To develop at Phase 2 speed, you'll have to confront your ignorance fearlessly, putting in the time and effort to expand your understanding even when it feels like you're moving at a snail's pace.

Read every error message. Twice. Thoroughly. Let the code's feedback mechanism guide you to a deeper understanding of how all the pieces come together. When you make something work, try to break it; see if you can predict what the error message will be. Errors are your friends! Don't hate on them, listen to them and learn from them.

It's all about finding the joy in your work. And this phase is pretty awesome.

Because in the next three weeks, you will become a web developer.

TO DO THIS WEEKEND:

Complete the listed prep work above.

We're going to cover introductions to HTTP and Sinatra, as well as touching on a harder ActiveRecord challenge. Sinatra is the web framework we'll be using throughout the phase. Read the tutorial and follow the examples -- you should create a small Sinatra app if you're actually following along. Don't _just_ read. Get your hands dirty.

Please remember to read the two articles on sexism and microaggressions in tech this weekend (listed above). This Tuesday afternoon, we'll have an EE on microaggressions that will include pragmatic small group discussions around sexism in tech.

To prepare for that EE, the men of the phase will have a Sexism 101 EE on Monday afternoon. That EE provides men a lower-stakes space for unpacking more overarching questions about sexism that, in the past, took time away from discussing solutions in the Tuesday EE. It also ensures that staff, and not students, are shouldering the task of answering questions about sexism. Please let me know if you have any questions about these EEs.

It's a beautiful weekend to code. And there's so much to learn! If you're not active on a Slack together, now's a great time to start sharing posts, cheat sheets, videos, or other resources that helped you understand something better. And if you've neglected to leave feedback for any of your pairs this past phase, you should hop on feedback.devbootcamp.com and make sure they get that actionable, specific, and kind gift.

See you Monday!
