## Learning Objectives
1. Understand how to make a ruby gem.
1. Publish your gem to the RubyGems.org website.

## Summary
Gem files allow us to package ruby functionality for reuse and to publish it for others to use. Writing your own gems give you ultimate POWER.

## Releases
### Release 1
* Read [Making Ruby Gems](http://timelessrepo.com/making-ruby-gems) and [What is a gem](http://guides.rubygems.org/what-is-a-gem/)for a high level overview of gems and how to build them. 
* Work through the [Make your own gem](http://guides.rubygems.org/make-your-own-gem/) tutorial to make the 'hola' gem.


### Release 2
* Create the 'faker-lite' gem that gives you back at least 3 faker fields not included in the original [Faker Gem](http://faker.rubyforge.org/).  For example you might make `Faker::MovieQuote.monty_python` to give you back cool things to say at your next party; or if you'd like to get invited to more parties you might go for `Faker::MovieQuote.fight_club`.  
* Use your gem in a simple sinatra application. 

### Release Awesome!
* If you think you've created something awesome and useful then make sure your gem has a good [name](http://guides.rubygems.org/name-your-gem/) and [publish](http://guides.rubygems.org/publishing/) your gem to [RubyGems.org](https://rubygems.org/)!
