## Core Challenges

You can choose whomever you would like to work with for this challenge. You can work by yourself, with a pair, or with a small group (max 4 students). 

### Build Something Beautiful & Meaningful

#### Learning Competencies

  * Building a web application from scratch
  * Managing the development process

#### Summary

You've learned a lot in phase 2: Sinatra, Active Record, JavaScript, Agile, and much more. Each of these tools is useful in its own right, but together, they give you something much more powerful â€” the ability to build a web application from nothing.

For this challenge, your assignment is to build something. It can be as practical or trivial as you would want, as long as it is a 100% functional, full-stack web application.

You can build anything you want, provided that it meets the following requirements:

- It has a database
- It uses an API (what does this mean?! explore!)
- It is styled
- It utilizes JavaScript

Once you've come up with an idea, get one of your teachers to approve it.

You will have all day Thursday, and all of Friday to work on this challenge. We will present these projects Friday at 3:00 PM.
