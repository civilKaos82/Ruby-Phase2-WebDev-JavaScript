# Javascript the Language

Javascript is a programming language. It's actually a pretty simple one, though
it's kind of hard.

## :+1:

1. I can define variables that contain Strings, Numbers, Functions and Objects
1. I am comfortable passing functions as arguments to other functions
1. I declare variables with the `var` keyword to prevent them from being
   defined at the global scope
1. I can iterate over the elements in an arrays and the key/value pairs in
   objects
1. I can use [objects](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/websites/javascript-foundations/objects/basic-objects) as key-value pairs
1. I reference the [documentation for
javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference) frequently
1. I always use `===` for equality tests and I understand why this won't test
   value equality for arrays and objects
1. I understand that every function creates a new scope for variable names
1. I can accurately trace what
[this](http://trephine.org/t/index.php?title=Understanding_JavaScript%27s_this_keyword) will be in most instances
1. I can use a constructor function to create a class
1. I use (and know when to use) `prototype` to add methods to classes
1. I can use object literal syntax
1. I understand the difference between a construction function and
object literal

## :+1: :+1:

1. I group related functions into objects to avoid namespace collisions
1. I know how to use `Object.create` to create an object
1. I write functions which take functions as an argument
1. I use the [module
pattern](http://www.adequatelygood.com/JavaScript-Module-Pattern-In-Depth.html) to keep my functions and variables out of the
   global scope
1. I can copy properties from one object into the prototype of a constructor
   function to add behavior to its instances
1. I understand that the variable scopes captured by functions are kept around
   as long as the function is referenced by other code


## :+1: :+1: :+1:

1. I write functions that return functions when appropriate
1. I can use [call and
apply](http://trephine.org/t/index.php?title=JavaScript_call_and_apply) to rebind `this` for given functions
1. I understand that there's always a sensible alternative to `with` and `eval`
1. I understand that named functions have their delcarations "hoisted" to the
   top of the scope in which they are declared
1. I understand how to implement prototypical inheritance using the `__proto__`
   property of an object (or the `Object.{get/set}PrototypeOf` functions)
