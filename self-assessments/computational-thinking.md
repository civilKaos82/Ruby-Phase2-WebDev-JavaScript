# Computational Thinking

[Computational
Thinking](http://www.google.com/edu/programs/exploring-computational-thinking/index.html#!what-is-ct)
is the main skill that programmers have.  It is the set of
problem-solving skills and techniques that software engineers use to
create, improve, and debug the programs they write.

Computational Thinking can be broken into 4 sections:
- Decomposition
- Pattern Recognition
- Pattern Generalization and Abstraction
- Algorithm Design

Below are a set of behaviors and knowledge that support and
demonstrate these problem solving skills.

## :+1:
1. When given a challenge release, I can break the problem down
into smaller steps.
1. When I break down a problem, I can usually get to some steps that I
know exactly how to do.
1. I can recognize an error I've seen in another piece of code.
1. I can fix an error in my code if I've already seen it in
another piece of code.
1. I can translate small pieces of code from one language to another.
(Ruby to JavaScript and vice versa).
1. I can read code written by a cohort-mate and understand what they
are trying to do.
1. I can read code from an instructor and understand what its
trying to do.

## :+1: :+1:
1. When I break a problem down into small steps, I can get to steps
small enough that I know exactly how to do each one.
1. I can see similarities in error even when the two pieces of code do
totally different things (i.e. Sinatra and ActiveRecord)
1. I can translate code from one language to another.
(Ruby to JavaScript and vice versa).

## :+1: :+1: :+1:
1. When I break a problem down into small steps, I can explain each
step to someone else.
1. I can see similarities in error even when the two pieces of code
are in different languages. (i.e. Ruby and JavaScript)
